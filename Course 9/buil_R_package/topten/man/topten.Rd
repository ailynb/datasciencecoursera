\title{Building a Model with Top Ten Features}
\usage{
topten(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a n x p matrix of n observations and p predictors}

\item{y}{a vector of length n representing the response}
}
\value{
a vector of coefficients from the final fitted model with top 10 features
}
\description{
This function develops a prediction algorithm based on the top 10 features in 'x' that are most predictive of 'y'
}
\details{
this function runs a univariate regression of y on each predictor in x and calculates a p-value indicating the
significance of the association. The final set of 10 predictors is taken from the 10 smallest p-values.
